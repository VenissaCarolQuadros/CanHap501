title: No-tech Puppeteering

### Introduction
The task at hand was to make 3 human-actuated human sketches to create motion for visual and haptic feedback. With the aesthetics being of little relevance and building Rube Goldberg machines being simple enough, the emphasis given to the haptic feedback aspect was perhaps the biggest hurdle to overcome in the design process. 

There were so many options for creating things that moved- fancy and distracting ones at that, but I believe the three sketches I finally arrived at do the assignment justice.

### Peep into the process...
I didn't want to design something and then realize that I don't have the stuff to build it. So, the first thing I needed to accomplish the task of making things move was, well- things!  Since I don't seem to have accumulated stuff I don't need (yet!), I went to the next best option: SRL. I quickly learnt (and you will possibly too) that there is no dearth of stuff that I could use, and so I moved on to the designing and building.
